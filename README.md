# Project Eyesight
For people with impaired vision.

## Usage
When the application has started you will see the normal view.
For accessing the application settings you have to hold down the time-board for around 10 seconds.
The wait time is due to prevent accessing the settings by mistake.
When using the cards and buttons you will hold it down until the vibrator stops. It is to prevent actions by mistake.
